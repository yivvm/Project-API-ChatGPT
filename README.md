# OpenAI Chat Interface

This project implements a simple command-line chat interface using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model. Users can interact with the GPT-3.5 model by providing input through the command line, and the model will generate responses based on the provided input.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have an API key from OpenAI. If you don't have one, you can obtain it by signing up at [OpenAI Developer](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
4. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your OpenAI API key in the following format:

    ```
    API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

5. Run the application using `npm start`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model through the command line. Enter your message or query, and the model will generate a response based on the input.

## Code Structure

The JavaScript code utilizes the `openai` library to interact with the GPT-3.5 model. It sets up a simple command-line interface using the `readline` module to accept user input. When the user enters a message, it sends the input to the GPT-3.5 model for processing and displays the generated response in the console.
